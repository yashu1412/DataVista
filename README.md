The build command for your **server** depends on the runtime environment and how you plan to deploy it. If your **server** is built with **Node.js and Express**, you typically don't need a build step like in frontend projects. However, if you're using TypeScript or Babel, you might need to transpile your code.

### **Common Build Commands for the Server**  

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **For a Basic Node.js Server (No Build Needed)**
If your server is written in plain JavaScript (`server.js` or `index.js`), you don‚Äôt need a build step. You just run:

```sh
npm run dev  # Starts the server in development mode
npm start    # Starts the server in production mode
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **For a JavaScript-Based Server**
If your server is written in **TypeScript**, you need to compile it before running:

```sh
npm run build   # Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start       # Runs the compiled code
```

You should have a `package.json` script like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **For a Babel-Based Server**
If you're using **Babel** to transpile ES6+ code:

```sh
npm run build   # Transpiles the code
npm start       # Runs the built server
```

The `package.json` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
  "build": "babel src -d dist",
  "start": "node dist/index.js"
}
```

### **Final Deployment Command**
After building the server (`npm run build` if using TypeScript or Babel), you can deploy the production version with:

```sh
npm start
```
